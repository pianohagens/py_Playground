C949_Data Structures and Algorithms I covers the fundamentals of dynamic data structures, such as bags, lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, and their associated algorithms. With Python software as the basis, the course discusses object-oriented design and abstract data types as a design paradigm. The course emphasizes problem solving and techniques for designing efficient, maintainable software applications. I have learned simple applications using the techniques .
